## Parallel Algorithm

Important factors:

1. Number of processors

2. Time

Operation is the product of time and number of processors.

## Summation: sum n numbers together

### 1. 大于等于n/2个processor Time：log2（n）        
Divide and conquer with n/2 processors. Then we can always do each step in parallel, so the time is the number of steps, log(n).
就是两两配对，类似一个倒着的binary tree，因此processor：n/2个，Time：log2（n）total operations: n/2 * log2(n)    

    ```
    for (i = 0, i < log(n), ++i) {
        for P % 2^(i+1) == 0 do in parallel {
            // P starts with 0.
            A[P] = A[P] + A[P+2^i];
        }
    }
    ```
### 2. n/T个processor         
先每个组T个数字，分成n/T个组，此时每个组1个processor，顺序相加O(T)；然后每组的结果一共是n/T用n/T个processor通过上述方法相加，为O(log(n/T))。复杂度也是T + log(n/T) <= log(n)      
(1)Group by 32 numbers in each group and there are n/32 groups with n/32 processors. Sequentially sum 32 numbers need 31 operations.
```
	 # do in parallel for 32 groups 
	for (i = 0 to n/32;) do in parallel    
 	{
     	 	# sequentially sum 32 numbers in each group
     		for(j = 0; j < 32; j++)   
     		{
          		Sum[i] = Sum[i] + Num[j];
    		}
	}
```
  T = O(32) (in fact 31) 
  
(2)Get sum of each group and there are n/32 numbers left with n/32 processors. According to last question:      
```
 	for (i = 0; i < log(n/32); i++) 
	 {
		for P % 2 ^ (i + 1) == 0 do in parallel 
		{
        		Sum[P] = Sum[P] + Sum[P + 2 ^ i];
    		}
	}
```
  T = O(log(n/32)) <= O(log(n))

### 3. n/log(n)个processor  O(log(n))       
先每个组log(n)个数字，分成n/log(n)个组，此时每个组1个processor，顺序相加O(log(n))；然后每组的结果一共是n/log(n)用n/log(n)个processor通过上述方法相加，为O(log(n)), total operations: n/log2(n) * log2(n)      
Use less processors. Group by log(n) numbers, and use n/log(n) processors. Then we have one processor for each group, and we can sum each group sequentially in log(n) time, then use all the n/log(n) processors to add n/log(n) numbers divide and conquer in log(n/log(n)) time. The overall time is still O(log(n)).

### 4. p <n processors. 
(1)Group by n/p numbers in each group and there are p groups with p processors. Therefore, each group will have 1 processor. Sequentially sum n/p numbers need n/p-1 operations.

```
 	# do in parallel for p groups 
	for (i = 0 to p;) do in parallel    
 	{
      		# sequentially sum n/p numbers in each group
     		for(j = 0; j < p; j++)   
     		{
          		Sum[i] = Sum[i] + Num[j];
    		}
	}
```
T = O(n/p) (in fact n/p-1)
(2)Get sum of each group and there are p numbers left with p processors. According to last question:
```
 	for (i = 0; i < log(p); i++) 
 	{
		for j % 2 ^ (i + 1) == 0 do in parallel 
		{
        		Sum[j] = Sum[j] + Sum[j + 2 ^ i];
    		}
	}
```
  T = O(log(p)) 

Total=n/p+log2(p) <= O(n)

### 5. 并行和Sequential    
Theorem for lower bound of time: A step with P processors in T time can be translated into a sequential processor in P * T time.
并行的时候，P个processor处理一次用T_1时间，和1个processor处理P次的时间。         
So for best sequential time T_1, then P * T >= T_1. So for summing, the sequential time is O(n)(in fact n-1), this is the lower bound for P * T.

## Minimum:  find the minimum in n given numbers

### 1. Naive: n^2 processors:
用完全图complete graph的方法，所有n个结点都连起来就会有n * (n - 1) / 2条边， 每条边都代表两个数在进行比较。所以当有n^2个processor的时候只要O(1)次比较就可以了。两两进行比较，较大的数标记为1，较小的数标记为0。最后没有被标记过1的数就是最小数。set 1 on the larger number, return the number with 0. The time is constant.

### 2. n^(3/2) processors:
n个数，分成n^(1/2)个组，这样每个组就是n^(1/2)个数。每个组都有n个processor，因此满足上面提到的平方的关系，就可以O(1)找到每个组的最小值。然后将n^(1/2)个最小值再用n个processor比较O(1)就找到了。因此一共是n^(3/2)个processor和O(1)时间。Use less processors. Group by n^(1/2), each group uses n processors, altogether n^(3/2) processors. Then merge within constant time.

3. $n$ numbers, $n^{\frac{5}{4}}$ processors: Group by $n^{\frac{1}{4}}$, the needed number of processors is just $(n^{\frac{1}{4}})^2\cdot{n}^{\frac{3}{4}}$. Then there are $n^{\frac{3}{4}}$ numbers to merge, group by $n^{\frac{3}{8}}$, the needed number of processors is $n^{\frac{9}{8}}$, less than $n^{\frac{5}{4}}$.

4. $n$ numbers, $n$ processors: Group by $\sqrt{n}$, can be merged with available $n$ processors; Subgroup by $n^{\frac{1}{4}}$, can be merged with available $\sqrt{n}$ processors, till the end. $T(n,n)=1+T(n^{\frac{1}{2}},n^{\frac{1}{2}})=i+T(n^{\frac{1}{2^i}},n^{\frac{1}{2^i}})$. When $n^{\frac{1}{2^i}}$ is constant $c$, then $i$ is $log(log(n))$.

Maximum independent set: The maximum set of vertices with no connecting edges between them.

6. When we have an algorithm using $P$ processors running in $T_P$ time, then we can simulate this algorithm with $p<P$ processors within $\frac{P\cdot{T}_P}{p}+T_p$. So this is linear for $p>n$, since we have $log(log(n))$ for $n$ and $1$ for $n^{\frac{5}{4}}$.
