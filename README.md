# Parallel Algorithm Notes

## BIG THANKS:
Big THANKS to @zenozeng : https://github.com/zenozeng/parallel-algorithm-notes

I forked his notes while I cannot make it private during the class(fork repository can not be private). Therefore, I clone his notes and reupload to make the repository privately during my class time. 

Mainly notes are from his repository and I uploaded more of mine in src & hw folders.

I will not upload note from teacher or other private source, while if you are a junior student who are going to have this class in ZJU. You can contact with me for more information and materials.

## Mention:
You are allowed to read all the codes and files, but you are not allowed to copy directly for your assignments! BTW, I cannot guarantee my correctness of homework.

Please try yourself and have fun working on those questions!
