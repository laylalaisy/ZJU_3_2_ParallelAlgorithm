# Parallel Algorithm Notes

## BIG THANKS:
Big THANKS to @zenozeng : https://github.com/zenozeng/parallel-algorithm-notes

I forked his notes while I cannot make it private during the class. Therefore, I clone his notes and reupload to make the repository private. 

Mainly notes are from his repository and I uploaded more of mine in note_layla & hw_layla folders.

## Mention:
You are allowed to read all the codes and files, but you are not allowed to copy directly for your assignments!

Please try yourself and have fun working on those interesting projects!

## Courese Information：
1. Course: Parallel Algorithm in ZJU
2. Time: 2018/03/01 - 2018/07/01 

## Syllabus:
1. May 28: Survey students’ capability, covering parallel computation models, parallel summation, computing minimum.

2. June 4: Complexity curve for minimum, prefix, optimization for prefix.

3. June 11: Linked list prefix, pointer jumping, linked list coloring. Complexity curve for linked list coloring.

4. June 18: Optimization for linked list prefix. Bitonic sorting. Integer sorting. Selection. All pairs shortest paths.


## Program Infromation:
1. See each program under hw_layla folders named hwx.     
2. Including:    
    · hwx_question.pdf / hwx_requirement.pdf: project's requirement from Professor   
    · hwx_report.pdf: final project's report (Plz don't hand in for your homework though I deleted my private information)
    · hwx_note.pdf: project's note and reference links
